# MAJOR.MINOR.ADJUSTMENTS

1.4.0
    New way on how iterators work to all collections
        Added iter_init to work with stack allocated iterators
        Added iter_new and iter_free to work with heap allocated iterators
        Added two pointers to functions (it_start and it_end) that allow you to access iterators to both start and end of the target collection easily
        iter_next and iter_prev now only move the iterator
        To access the key, value and index, use a separate function
    Removed FOR_EACH_MAP as it is no longer necessary since FOR_EACH also works to associative containers now
    Updated benchmark, examples and tests to work on these new iterators
    Changed pointertype test to be a pointer to struct instead of pointer to char
    Added CHANGELOG and TODO

1.3.0
    Changed how the linkedlist functions relative to nodes work
        Removed reference to owner list on each node
        Renamed some functions for consistency

1.2.4
    Fixing some declarations in hashset and hashmap where a pointer type would cause problems
    Added a test to make sure all collections support pointer type
    Tests:
        - pointertype

1.2.3
    Added get_ref functions to all collections that support it (only included in hashmap, linkedlist, list and treemap)

1.2.2
    Removed unnecessary modulo operation in hashtable functions

1.2.1
    Optimized list - now using 'string.h' functions to shift elements around instead of for-loops:
        - memset
        - memcpy
        - memmove

1.2.0
    'contains' functions added to all collections
    'contains' tests and benchmark
    Unified Benchmark
    Updated examples

1.1.3
    Renamed deque's 'rear' struct member to 'back' to be more consistent with other collections
    Better benchmark and foreach tests are alphabetically ordered

1.1.2
    Fixing iterators for when they are initialized with an empty target
    Better iterator tests
    More examples

1.1.1
    Reordering functions (implementation details are now at the end of each file)

1.1.0
    Added new list functions:
        - new_from
        - prepend
        - insert
        - append
        - remove
        - fits

1.0.1
    Fixed hashset logic in robin-hood hashing

1.0.0
    First stable version
    Includes the following collections:
        - deque
        - hashmap
        - hashset
        - heap
        - linkedlist
        - list
        - queue
        - stack
        - treemap
        - treeset
    Two-way iterators
    Benchmarks
    Tests:
        - foreach
        - iterator
